// Challenge 1 of 5: Fix reconnecting on every keystroke 
// In this example, the ChatRoom component connects to the 
// chat room when the component mounts, disconnects when it 
// unmounts, and reconnects when you select a different chat 
// room. This behavior is correct, so you need to keep it working.

// However, there is a problem. Whenever you type into the 
// message box input at the bottom, ChatRoom also reconnects 
// to the chat. (You can notice this by clearing the console 
//   and typing into the input.) Fix the issue so that this 
//   doesnâ€™t happen.

// There was no dependency array.
// Added array and passed the roomId prop as it is reactive.
// serverUrl is a variable outside the component, so is not reactive.
// Even if serverUrl was inside the component, it would not need to
// be a dependency as its value does not change, aka const.
// serverUrl would only need to be added to the dependency array if
// it was managed through a state or passsed as a prop.
